It was the first year of CS&C. I met SFML and created this thing in Code::Blocks...

Now I've a bit updated it and hope to continue soon

### How to start with it?

1. You should have SFML installed. 
2. For Linux it seems like that's all. Open it in some CLion or run  CMake thing(`cmake --build`, right?).
3. For Windows - who knows where to install such libraries. Get SFML(get it [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php), btw) and corresponding compiler(check at the same download page) 
4. I've put them in C:/lib. If you have different installation - update  `CMakeLists.txt`.
5. Now open it in some CLion or anything else.

And now refactor it, add some interesting things and have a good time, Yevhenii. 
Yes, I know your name, because who even care what lies in this repo?
That's message in future Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

P.S. If you're not me - oops. Don't blame me for this shitty code. Especially if I've updated it since writing this readme.
I just wanted some real programming, not these Java things... (jk, it's just reviving old things for funðŸ™ƒ)
